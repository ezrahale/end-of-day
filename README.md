# End of Day

A lab for quiet preparation in a loud world.

 ## Cycles

Explorations of modern life, technology, and sovereignty. 
Each cycle uses whatever methods fit its theme â€” writing, field work, tool development, or research.

- **[001: Handshake](cycles/001-handshake/)** - Connection, digital overwhelm, ambient surveillance
- **[002: Presence](cycles/002-presence/)** - In development
