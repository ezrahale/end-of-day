## BEGIN LOG

These days… I don't talk much. Not because I don't have anything to say— But because I'm not sure anyone's really listening anymore.

There's too much noise. Endless feeds of opinions dressed up as facts. "Content" everywhere. You can scroll for hours and never find anything meaningful.

We've drowned out silence. Permanently. Boredom is forbidden! There's always something playing. Always someone talking. Always something to react to. It never shuts off. We just… tune in and out of it. Like a station we forgot we could turn off.

Why does everything feel like a sales pitch now? Even when there's nothing to buy. The product is you. Your attention. Your data. Your peace.

We never really log off anymore. When was the last time you actually signed out of Instagram? Or Facebook? You just close the app… but you're still there. Still connected. Still being watched. Still performing.

And I think… That's what's got me tired. It's all noise.

Even the "educational" stuff feels like noise now. Like it's trying too hard to be digestible. Shareable. Viral. Everything's fighting for your eyes. Your ears. Your time.

Sometimes, I wonder if we're drowning in it— Or if we've become it.

I know nostalgia is a thief of the present… But I feel it creeping in sometimes. I can't help it.

I miss dial-up. I miss when being connected meant something. When you had to ask permission. When there were limits.

I'd ask my mom if I could go online. And she'd say: "You've got 30 minutes."

Because back then, getting online meant the phone line was busy. There was a cost to connection. A trade-off. A reason to be intentional.

The sound of it connecting? If you know, you know. A glitchy, alien symphony— That let you know something real was happening.

There was friction. Boundaries. And in that space… meaning.

I remember surfing. Not scrolling — surfing. Exploring the web. Playing flash games. Sending messages. The joy of seeing your friends online. That was connection. That was exciting.

Then you'd log off. Turn the computer off. And that was enough.

But now? We're always on. There's no off-switch. No moment where we step away. We bring it with us everywhere.

Connected? Sure. But what do we even mean by that word anymore?

It feels less like connection— More like notification. Like background noise. Always on. Always pinging. Always pulling.

And it's leaking into everything.

Conversations feel like Instagram feeds. Fast. Surface-level. Disposable.

We speak in memes. We swipe past nuance. We watch headlines like they're Netflix trailers.

Entertainment has eaten everything. Even grief. Even war. Even pain. Even truth.

I don't think we know how to connect anymore. Not on a human level. Not without the algorithm as a middleman.

We're always performing. Always producing. Always available. And somehow— Always lonely.

So maybe that's what this is. A log. A record.

Not because I want an audience But because I want to remember what it feels like to speak… Without being watched. To write… Without optimizing. To be… Without broadcasting.

Maybe we need to log off. Sign out. Close the tab.

And only sign back in when there's something worth saying. Something real. Something that isn't just noise.

Until then…
